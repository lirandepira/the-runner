### Introduction
The application at hand is a multi-user running application which tracks the running path of the User.
While used, the application records constantly the GPS of the phone, which then displays the recorded running path, 
time, the maximum speed and the average speed.


### Design Goals
This section of the document describes the design goals - both, front-end and back-end - 
that have been setup before starting coding the application.
